/**
 * DEPRECATED!
 *
 * NOTE!
 *
 * This file was previously used by a number of templates to dynamically alter the region-ids in the template.
 * The preferred way of chaning components for a region is now to use extension module's and their component evaluators.
 * A number of webscript components also use it to calculate the rootNode for the repository library, do not use this
 * file for that anymore.
 *
 * If you have a reference to this file, i.e.
 * <import resource="classpath:/alfresco/templates/org/alfresco/documentlibrary.js">
 *
 * Please change that to point to the follwing file instead:
 * <import resource="classpath:/alfresco/templates/org/alfresco/documentlibrary.deprecated.js">
