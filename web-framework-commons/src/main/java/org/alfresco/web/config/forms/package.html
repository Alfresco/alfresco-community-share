<title>org.alfresco.web.config.forms package</title>
</head>
<body>
Contains the classes that implement the configuration of the forms service including
<code>ConfigElement</code> and <code>ElementReader</code> classes as well as various
other data classes.
Although there are a number of implementations of
{@link org.alfresco.config.xml.elementreader.ConfigElementReader}, only
{@link FormsElementReader} is registered with the ConfigService and the other
<code>ConfigElementReader</code> classes are delegated to.

<P>
Note that it is anticipated that these classes will predominantly be used by
JavaScript&#8482; client code and for that reason, the public API of this package favours
e.g. <code>String[]</code> return types instead of <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> types.
In many cases, an overloaded method which returns a Collection is provided as a
convenience for Java client code.
